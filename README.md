**WeCare**

My medication reminder app “weCare” is an android app project which is here to be a helping hand to old or forgetful or busy people who tend to forget about their important medication schedule. This app will track down their daily medication time to help store pills beforehand. By ringing alarm for once to multiple times a day, it ensures taking medicine. Also, it may feature medication history to show the total usage.
